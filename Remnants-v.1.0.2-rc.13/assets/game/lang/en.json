  "game:characterdesc-wanderer": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>Banished far to a land of despair, Where shadows writhe and taint the air. A Wanderer walks, their crime unknown, Cursed to suffer, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>With less of a focus on pure exploration like Malefactors, Wanderers instead drive themselves to maintain their existence in the wilds. They excel in self-reliance and have trained extensively with a blade, however their nomadic lifestyle leaves them with little patience for skills such as hunting & mining.",
  "game:characterclass-ironmonger": "Ironmonger",
  "game:characterdesc-ironmonger": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>Beneath the ashes, in darkness deep, In fetid caverns, where creatures creep. The Ironmonger strikes, their pick on stone. For scraps of iron, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>Born with pick in hand, the Ironmongers are industrious and careful individuals, specializing in mining and charcoal production. With an eye for ores and gears, they are well suited underground, however a life spent in charter mines have them used to full bellies, and have left their bodies worse for wear.",

  "game:characterdesc-hedgeknight": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>Without a banner, a warrior does stray, With rusted steel and skies of grey. A Hedge Knight’s shield, in moonlight does shone, An unpledged bulwark, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>Titans of combat, these remnants of the Order of the Forlorn Hope were dedicated to holding the line against the rising tide of Rot. Their sturdy armor & constitution helps sustain them in battle, but not every situation is one they can fight their way out of.",

  "game:characterdesc-serf": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>Toiling among the fields and groves, With mud-caked boots they left in droves. A Serf doth harvest, that which they’ve sown, Blood & sweat, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>Dedicated to cultivation & husbandry, Serfs are a staple of any developing world. Their robust bodies and skilled hands form the cornerstone of any community that wants to survive in these harsh lands, but their lack of skill with armor and mining can lead to disaster if forced to delve deep underground.",

A Yeoman’s arrow, of sharpened bone, their watch will keep, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>Deadly on the battlefield, Yeoman are highly sought after by kings and barons to fill their retinues in times of war. Equally suited to hiding among shadows as standing watch atop a keep, their mastery of the longbow is unmatched. They are unsuited in a melee however, preferring to let the cheaper levies fight in their place.",

  "game:characterdesc-woodsman": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>Among the plains, beneath the boughs, A satchel of mushrooms, a pair of sows. From Woodsman’s sling, a rock has flown, The forest he roams, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>Feeling more at home amongst the woods & wilds of the world, they are experts at harvesting all of natures bounties. Used to hunting small beasts with sling or bow, their slim frame leaves them lacking if caught by more formidable prey.",

The Malefactor strips the land, seeking to atone, For a life of sin, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>The Malefactors are those forced to pilfer the ruins and lands of the wild, simply for a promise to return to a world that no longer exists. Their exile to the wasteland leaves them physically weak, but with a unique eye for valuables among the ruins of the old world.",
  "game:characterclass-guildsman": "Guildsman",
  "game:characterdesc-guildsman": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>Craftsmen and Merchants, backbones of trade, A forgotten era, when bonds were made. The Guildsman labors, with purpose unknown, Endlessly toiling, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>Originally of the landed gentry in the distant past, Guildsmen was a catch all for those such as minstrels, merchants, craftsmen & the like. While they are well suited to tasks of an urban tilt, they lack meaningful brawn or ability with the blades and armor they once peddled.",

  "game:characterdesc-gearsmith": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>The grinding gear, the turning wheel, The Project ascended with fervent zeal. The Gearsmith’s failure, in their vile groan, Rusted and stagnant, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>The remnants of what were the robust ranks of Clockworkers, Engineers, and Tinkerers, the Gearsmith carries the legacy of technical prowess with them. Their knowledge of mechanical structures gives them an edge when dealing with the twisted machines of the past, but they lack skill with ranged weapons & their noisy work renders them not particularly stealthy.",
  "game:characterclass-blackguard": "Blackguard",
  "game:characterdesc-blackguard": "<font color=\"#99c9f9\"><i>In fires of war they reave and raid, Splitting foes with blackened blade. The Blackguard fights, the empty throne, Endless clashes, forever alone.</i></font><br><br>All that remains of the final defense against the onslaught of Rot, these reckless fighters put everything they had into holding the line. Their raw aggression makes them unmatched in a brawl, but their darker nature often leads to them hoarding resources, while believing such “menial” work below them.",
